## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?
See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording. 
 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

* Easy to understand
* Good for reproducibility
** It is easy to compile reports **
* I like that we are able to knit to PDFs or HTML *


## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

```{r making tables}


dataset.name <- c("EPA Air", "NEON NWIO Litter", 
                  "NTL LTER Lake Chem", "NTL LTER Lake Nutrients", 
                  "Ozone", "Wind Speed")

dataset.info <- c("PM25 and O3 information", 
                  "different litter information", 
                  "lake chemistry info", "lake nutrients info", 
                  "time series ozone", "data regarding wind speeds")

dataframe <- data.frame(dataset.name, dataset.info)

knitr::kable(dataframe, caption = "Table with Datasets and Information", 
             col.names = c("Datasets", "Information"))



```



## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("knitr")


```



### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

```{r setup, message =FALSE}
#getting working directory
getwd()
setwd("/Users/saradiamond/Documents/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2022/Lessons")

#loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)

#setting theme
mytheme <- theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)
```


Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.


Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

```{r Loading Data, echo=FALSE}
#loading data
NTL.LTER.Nutrients <- read.csv('./Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv')

#showing head
head(NTL.LTER.Nutrients)

#changing to date
NTL.LTER.Nutrients$sampledate <- as.Date(NTL.LTER.Nutrients$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

#checking class
class(NTL.LTER.Nutrients$sampledate)

```



### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r Data Exploration}

#wrangling the data
NTL.LTER.Processed <- 
  NTL.LTER.Nutrients %>%
  select(-c(lakeid, depth_id, comments)) %>%
  filter(depth == 0) %>%
    drop_na()
#saving processed file
write.csv(NTL.LTER.Processed, 
          row.names = FALSE, 
          file = "./Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Processed.csv")
```


Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r Wrangling, echo=FALSE}

#total nitrogen dataset
NTL.LTER.TotalNit <- NTL.LTER.Processed %>% 
  group_by(lakename) %>% 
  summarise(mean_tn = mean(tn_ug),
            max_tn = max(tn_ug),
            min_tn = min(tn_ug),
            sd_tn = sd(tn_ug))

#total phosphorus dataset
NTL.LTER.TotalPhos <- NTL.LTER.Processed%>% 
  group_by(lakename) %>% 
  summarise(mean_tp = mean(tp_ug),
            max_tp = max(tp_ug),
            min_tp = min(tp_ug),
            sd_tp = sd(tp_ug))
```


Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r Tables, echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(NTL.LTER.TotalNit, caption = "Summary of Total Nitrogen", col.names = c("Lake Name", "Mean", "Max", "Min", "Std Dev"))

knitr::kable(NTL.LTER.TotalPhos, caption = "Summary of Total Phosphorous", col.names = c("Lake Name", "Mean", "Max", "Min", "Std Dev"))


```


Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r Total Nitrogen, echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap="Total Nitrogen Over Time for Each Lake"}
#plot for total nitrogen
ggplot(data = NTL.LTER.Processed, aes(x = sampledate, 
                                      y = tn_ug, color = lakename)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
    labs(title = "Total Nitrogen Over Time for Each Lake", 
         x = "Date", 
         y = "Total Nitrogen", 
         color = "Lake Name")


```


```{r Total Phosphorous, echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap="Total Phosphorous Over Time for Each Lake"}

#plot for total phosphorus
ggplot(data = NTL.LTER.Processed, aes(x = sampledate, 
                                      y = tp_ug, color = lakename)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
    labs(title = "Total Phosphorous Over Time for Each Lake", 
         x = "Date", 
         y = "Total Phosphorous", 
         color = "Lake Name")

```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

The data set we used in this analysis was looking at different lakes in the Northern Temperate Lakes District in Wisconsin, USA. The data we have looked at was collected by an ecological research station over time. Specifically, we were looking at the total amount of nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients within the various lakes. In our analysis we were able to determine different statistics (average, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation) for the two different nutrients and compare our findings of each. It was found that for total nitrogen, Hummingbird Lake had the highest amount out of all 8 lakes we were examining. Additionally, by looking at the plot of total nitrogen over time, we can see that many of the lakes fluctuated in their total nitrogen, but West Long Lake, Peter Lake and East Long Lake had much higher fluctuations in between 1996 and 1998. As for phosphorous, East Long Lake had the highest maximum, but Hummingbird Lake had the highest total average. When looking at the plot for total phosphorous over time it is clear that East Long Lake had the most variability but we would have to do further analysis to determine exactly why that is. 

___

In order to determine more information, we might want to look to see if other variables are causeing an increase or descrease in the total amount of nutrients over time. We could do this by running some simple linear models to see if any variables are dependent on the total amount of nitrogen or phosphorous. For example, we could look at depth to see if this played a role or we could look at the presence of other nutrients in the total nitrogen/phosphorous observed. By conducting these analyses we could accept or reject a hypothesis saying that the presence of another nutrient had an effect on the total nitrogen or phosphorous amount in each lake. 


## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true
